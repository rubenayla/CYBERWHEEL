# Reasoning for main location of components
The inside of the EUC must hold its own weight, and it won't be subject to crashes or sudden crashes, since the rubber and rim separates it from the ground, and the internal components from crashes around it. Therefore, a strong and heat conductive material is ideal, not necessarily tough.

To gain maximum crash resistance, squishy stuff on the outside + rigid stuff inside is ideal, since nothing will penetrate the EUC and the acceleration will be softened. The pads will act as bumpers. The outside shell of the EUC must be optimized for crash resistance, not strength. This highly suggests using GFRP or similar.

The front will have lights and antennas.
