# CYBERWHEEL

## Purpose
Develop of open-source Electric Unicycle (EUC) Firmware and Hardware, hopefully achieving products that are safe, reliable, and durable, while being free of proprietary restrictions.

## Goals
I want to change the idea that, if your EUC cuts out, it's your fault. A well designed EUC should never cut power. There must be margin for error.

And this margin includes undervoltage AND overvoltage. Ideas to consider are a resistor or motor coil short-circuit braking, instead of dumping to the battery when it's full.

More on [requirements](./requirements.md).

## Features
- Sealed electronics and battery compartment
    - You can throw it in the sea and won't have to worry about it.
    - Probably an aluminum conducting chassis, or embedded heat sink.
